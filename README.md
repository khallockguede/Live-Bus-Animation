# Live Bus Animation

<img src=./bostonMap.png>

## Description:
<p> The red markers show the MIT & Harvard campuses. <br> The blue markers live track the Route 1 buses running between the two campuses. </p>

## How to Run:
<p> Clone all files to a single folder. <br> Insert your own [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com) token in the "busAnimation.js" file on line one where indicated. <br> Open the "index.html" folder in your browser.</p>

## Future Improvements:
<p> I plan to add different colored markers to indicate the direction the bus is heading. </p>
